<h3>Description</h3>
<section>
<p>The Internet is, by definition, a collection of networks throughout the world that agree to communicate using specific telecommunications protocols. But this definition doesnâ€™t describe what makes the Internet so exciting. The Internet can also be viewed in terms of the people who use it and the ways they communicate with each other to share information and ideas. It is also a place for people to do research, conduct business, and find information that may enrich their daily lives. The major difference between the Internet and other media, such as television, is that it is interactive and provides immediate feedback. We define the World Wide Web to be the collection of information available through the Internet.
